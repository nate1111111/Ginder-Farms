      <h2>Dexter Cows</h2>
      <p>
        Our farm is also home to a herd of adorable and gentle Dexter cows. Known for their small stature and friendly
        temperament, Dexters are perfect for small-scale farming and homesteading. Here are some key features of our Dexter
        breeding program:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Purebred Dexters: We maintain a purebred herd to preserve the breed's unique characteristics.</li>
        <li>High-Quality Genetics: Our cows are selectively bred for excellent conformation, temperament, and milk production.</li>
        <li>Healthy & Happy: We prioritize the well-being of our cows, providing them with spacious pastures and natural
          grazing.</li>
        <li>Sustainable Farming: Our farming practices prioritize environmental sustainability and promote biodiversity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
