Ginder-Farms
Website for Ginder Farms
This is a web developement project for the Lear group in the summer of 2023. My idea is to make a website for my families farm. We breed dexter cows and brew seasonal beers. The website isn't intended to sell anything. It's just a fun project to show off our cows and beer.
